# ingatlan

<p> This is a machine learning and web scraping project

<p>I extract data from ingatlan.com, which advertises real estate all over Hungary

<p>My plan is to build a zillow type database and predict the price of renting a flat based on the features available on their website
  
<p>I mostly rely on 2 libraries: scrapy,keras

# Downloader
<p>The Downloader folder contains the web scraping spider, its result is saved in items.csv
